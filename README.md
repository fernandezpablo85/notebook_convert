# Notebook Convert pre commit hook [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

[pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/) for converting jupyter notebooks to multiple formats.

## Motivation

- We ‚ù§Ô∏è Jupyter Notebooks

- Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for doing data analysis

- You should treat them like code and keep them safe and available on a git repository

- Jupyter Notebooks format is not so great for doing code reviews or PRs

- Jupyter Notebook default format is not the best for communicating with less code-literate teams

## How to solve this with a commit hook

This commit hook does a couple of things for you:

- Lets you choose from a set of available __formats__ (currently Markdown and PDF)

- When committing your notebook, it __checks__ that it has an up to date companion format file

- If theres none, it __generates__ one for you

## Requirements

- A running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation (generating different representations requires a lot of dependencies that are best encapsulated in a container)

## Installation

- Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

- Include _notebook convert_ as one of your hooks in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/notebook_convert
    rev: v0.0.1
    hooks:
    -   id: notebook_convert
```

By default it will generate Markdown output, but you can change it to PDF or RST by doing:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/notebook_convert
    rev: v0.0.1
    hooks:
    -   id: notebook_convert
        args: [--format=pdf]
```

If you want the converted files in a separate folder

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/notebook_convert
    rev: v0.0.1
    hooks:
    -   id: notebook_convert
        args: [--format=rst, --fileDestinationMode=mirror_folder]
```

(If you want more than one just include the hook twice üôÉ)

- Run `pre-commit install`

- Enjoy
